				<h1>LIQUID TIME</h1>
				<p>
					The modern society is facing a phenomenon of homogenization induced by globalization. This reality prompts a loss of meaning, jeopardizing the sense of identity. At a time of radical societal changes, our understanding of what iden- tity is, has shifted. As essential as it is to know who we are to impose ourselves in the urban crowd, overcoming issues around identity seems conceivable by finding a sense of belonging through local communities.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this essay, I hope to illuminate issues of identity from a sociological and social angle, through ideas of urban communities, in order to have a better understanding of how postmodern conditions have altered the core of identity.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the quest for identity, how do young people use ideas of community to build their sense of identity in New York and Tokyo in the modern age?
				</p>
				<p>
					Aiming to answer the research question, I articulate the theory of ‘liquid mo- dernity’ of Zygmunt Bauman, ideas of ‘fluid’ identity of Stuart Hall, concept of ‘performativity’ of Judith Butler and finally Manuel Castells’ sociological approach to the city and modernity, around two case studies — the queer community in New York City and the Fashion community of Harajuku in Tokyo. Relevant instances personally conducted through interviews expose the importance of belonging to a community to find a sense of belonging, and thus, a sense of identity.
