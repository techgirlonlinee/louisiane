	<p>Louisiane is an art director and visual artist. With a multidisciplinary approach, her work 
	focuses on <br>- but is not limited to - moving images, graphic design, set design, and interactive art. Influenced by the fast-paced modern society, she translates the transitory and ephemeral nature of our time into poetic and meaningful imagery. Drawing from her on-going research on gender and identity, Louisianeâ€™s works explore ways of disrupting the norms to embrace individuality and self-expression. Her practice has an open approach to collaboration, giving way to new conversations and mediums explorations to happen.</p>
